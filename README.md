There are multiple use cases in this app, all calibrated to meet the student's needs, for instance, in the GPA Calculator, you can add a subject and its respective grade and number of credit hours, and the GPA is calculated and displayed automatically. In the Calendar, you can add events with their discriptions and their due time on any date you wish to choose, and on the Daily To Do List, you can view all the to dos you have for the day, add more tasks and delete or edit existing ones. Finally you can study efficiently and neatly in accordance with the scientific Pomodoro Technique which is basically giving yourself sessions of 25 minutes for study time followed by 5 minute breaks.

## Development and Functionality



- Front-End and Design

    This app supports light and dark modes with color profiles that are appropriate for every scenario and sufficient for every user's needs.

    It implements a simplistic design with little to no visual obstacles. The design language focuses on simple, straight forward elements that blend together without     causing any visual hazards.

    The design of the app and implementation of a sliding navigation menu, in addition to putting all the small peices together was done by Fady Makram and Mina Adil.

- Back-End and Functionality


    - GPA Calculator

    In this section of the app, the user can add numerous subjects as needed. each subject added is represented by three fields of data, name, number of hours and         grade (A to F). On adding a subject the overall GPA is re-calculated with the newly added subject, then it is displayed. There is an option to view a list of all       added subjects if neeeded. On long pressing a subject from the list, the user gets the option to either delete the subject or edit any of its three fields. The         database is handled through SQLite.

    Implemented by Mina Nabil and Mina Khalifa.

    - Calendar Events Scheduler
    
    The calendar tool is a tool designed to forecast future events and record them in an organized matter to guide the student in the chaotic world of endless events       that we live in. In the calendar, you can choose any day, on choosing a day, a counter displays how many events you have on that day. The user can press the           "Manage Tasks" buttons to be redirected to the events scheduler window, in this window, all tasks are recorded, you have the option to add a new task or               delete/edit an existing one. Long pressing a task views the description of that task. The database is handled through SQLite.

    - Daily To Do List   
    
    This part of the app serves as a daily reminder utility that the student can use to keep track of the tasks they have to do today. The To Do List retrieves the         daily tasks that are previously recorded in the calendar. it allows the user to view those tasks and check them on completion or delete them, you can also edit         those tasks as desired. deleting a task from the Daily To Do list also deletes it from the calendar and vice versa. The database is handled through SQLite.

    - Pomodoro Technique Timer

    This is a simple counter based on the famous scientific technique that is the Pomodoro technique. The purpose of this part is to regulate the studying process of       the student and make it more comfortable and productive, it does so by displaying a 25 minute count down during which the student should study, then a 5 minute         counter starts after, marking the duration of the break that the student gets after each study session. there are options to pause the counter or just reset it all     together.
